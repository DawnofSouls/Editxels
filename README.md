# Editxels

A project based on Etch a Sketch project from The Odin Project.

## Demo

[â–¶ Live Demo](https://dawnofsouls.github.io/Editxels/)


## Features

- Paint and Erase!
- Custom size, up to 64pixels wide
- Save Image! (This is buggy)
- Toggle grid for easier painting!


## Known Bug Issues 

- It occasionally continues to paint even after releasing the left click button, and the only way to reset it is by refreshing the page. Alternatively, you can achieve this by holding down the left click button and then press the right-click button at the same time.
- Graphical issues dealing with grid showing up all wierd and wonky after downloading image so I set it to off whenever you press "Save Image".
- Pressing "Save Image" doesn't save what you see, it fills the background with white color until it reaches 1/1 full aspect ratio. Debating myself if I should remove that feature.
- Non-responsive: DON'T USE IT ON MOBILE AND DON'T RESCALE WINDOW SIZE

## Tech Stack

**Language:** HTML, CSS, Javascript




## Features I want to add (No guarantees)

#### 1: Color Picker

Standard color picker tool to call back the color you already used on your canvas
#### 2: Easy change background color
Pretty self explanatory. If your canvas is pretty big, it takes a while to fill the entire background with color of your choice by painting manually
